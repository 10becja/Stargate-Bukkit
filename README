Changes in 0.03
 - Changed package to net.TheDgtl.*
 - Everything now uses Blox instead of Block objects
 - Started on vehicle code, but it's still buggy
 
Known Issues:
 - Vehicle implementation is nowhere near done.
 - Signs aren't always updating, I don't know what's causing this, I think it's a Bukkit thing.

Installation:
 - Move Stargate.jar to your /plugins/ location
 - Setup Permissions

Permissions:
 - stargate.use
   - Allow this player/group to use stargates.
 - stargate.create
   - Allow this player/group to create new stargates.

 - stargate.hidden
   - Allow this player/group to see all hidden stargates.

Building a gate:
    OO 
   O  O - These are Obsidian blocks. You need 10.
   O  O - Place a sign on either of these two blocks of Obsidian.
   O  O
    OO
 - Type a name on the first line on the sign, it must be less than 12 characters long.
 - Type a set destination name on the second line if desired.
 - Type a network name on the third line if desired.
 - Type any options on the 4th line if desired.
 - Right click the sign block to initialize the gate as a Stargate.

Sign Layout:
 - Line 1: Gate Name (Max 12 characters)
 - Line 2: Destination Name (Max 12 characters, used for fixed-gates only)
 - Line 3: Network name (Max 12 characters)
 - Line 4: Options ('A' for always-on fixed gate, 'H' for hidden networked gate)

Using a gate:
 - Right click the sign to choose a destination.
 - Right click the button to open up a portal.
 - Step through.

Fixed gates:
 - Fixed gates are like normal gates, but only go to one destination.
 - If you create two fixed gates that point to eachother, you will have a two-way portal.
 - You can link fixed gates to normal gates, or to other fixed gates which can link to another fixed gate etc. You can't link a normal gate to a fixed gate though.
 - Creating a fixed gate is the same as a normal gate, but you must specify the destination on the second line.
 - Set the 4th line to "A" to enable an always-open fixed gate.

Gate networks:
 - Gates are all part of a network, by default this is "central".
 - You can specify (and create) your own network on the third line of the sign when making a new gate.
 - Gates on one network will not see gates on the second network, and vice versa.
 
Hidden Gates:
 - Hidden gates are like normal gates, but only show on the destination list of other gates under certain conditions.
 - They are visible to anyone with the stargate.hidden permission, or to the creator of the hidden gate.
 - Set the 4th line to "H" to make it a hidden gate.
 
Configuration:
 - You can edit all values in stargate.txt to your choosing, mostly the RP text on doing actions involving a gate.
