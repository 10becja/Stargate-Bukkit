 Description
=============
This is a port of the Stargate plugin from hMod by Dinnerbone.
Create gates that allow for instant-teleportation between large distances. Gates can be always-open, or triggered, they can be hidden, or accessible to everybody, they can share a network, or they can be split into clusters.
This port will import your existing locations.dat file from the hMod Stargate plugin!
iConomy support added back in, only costs are create, destroy and use.

=============
Instructions
=============
Building a gate:
    OO 
   O  O - These are Obsidian blocks. You need 10.
   O  O - Place a sign on either of these two blocks of Obsidian.
   O  O
    OO

Sign Layout:
 - Line 1: Gate Name (Max 12 characters)
 - Line 2: Destination Name [Optional] (Max 12 characters, used for fixed-gates only)
 - Line 3: Network name [Optional] (Max 12 characters)
 - Line 4: Options [Optional] :
 			'A' for always-on fixed gate
 			'H' for hidden networked gate
 			'P' for a private gate
 			'F' for a free gate
 			'B' is for a backwards facing gate (You will exit the back)

Options:
The options are the single letter, not the word. So to make a private hidden gate, your 4th line would be 'PH'.

Using a gate:
 - Right click the sign to choose a destination.
 - Right click the button to open up a portal.
 - Step through.

Fixed gates:
 - Fixed gates go to only one set destination.
 - Fixed gates can be linked to other fixed gates, or normal gates. A normal gate cannot open a portal to a fixed gate however.
 - To create a fixed gate, specify a destination on the second line of the stargate sign.
 - Set the 4th line of the stargate sign to "A" to enable an always-open fixed gate.

Gate networks:
 - Gates are all part of a network, by default this is "central".
 - You can specify (and create) your own network on the third line of the sign when making a new gate.
 - Gates on one network will not see gates on the second network, and vice versa.
 - Gates on different worlds, but in the same network, will see eachother.
 
Hidden Gates:
 - Hidden gates are like normal gates, but only show on the destination list of other gates under certain conditions.
 - A hidden gate is only visible to the creator of the gate, or somebody with the stargate.hidden permission.
 - Set the 4th line of the stargate sign to 'H' to make it a hidden gate.
 
iConomy Support:
 The latest version of Stargate has support for iConomy. Gate creation, destruction and use can all have different costs associated with them. You can also define per-gate layout costs. The default cost is assigned in the config.yml file, while the per-gate costs re defined in the .gate files. To define a certain cost to a gate just add these lines to your .gate file:
usecost=5
destroycost=5
createcost=5
toowner=true

==============
Custom Gate Layout
==============
You can create as many gate formats as you want, the gate layouts are stored in plugins/Stargate/gates/
The .gate file must be laid out a specific way, the first lines will be config information, and after a blank line you will lay out the gate format. Here is the default nether.gate file:

portal-open=90
portal-closed=0
X=49
-=49

 XX 
X..X
-..-
X*.X
 XX 

portal-open/closed are used to define the material in the gate when it is open or closed. 
"X" and "-" are used to define block "types" for the layout (Any single-character can be used, such as "#").
In the gate format, you can see we use "X" to show where obsidian must be, "-" where the controls (Button/sign) are.
You will also notice a "*" in the gate layout, this is the "exit point" of the gate, the block at which the player will teleport in front of.
As of version 0.5.5 you can supply block data in the format
X=35:15
Which would only allow black wool. If no data is supplied any version of a block will work (Any color of wool for example)
