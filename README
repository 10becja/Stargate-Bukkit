 Description
=============
This is a port of the Stargate plugin from hMod.
Create gates that allow for instant-teleportation between large distances. Gates can be always-open, or triggered, they can be hidden, or accessible to everybody, they can share a network, or they can be split into clusters.
This port will import your existing locations.dat file from the hMod Stargate plugin, as well as any custom .gate files you had!
All of the iConomy code was removed.

This version of Stargate is still heavily under development. There are going to be issues for a while yet.

=============
Known Issues
=============
 - Vehicle implementation is nowhere near done.
 - Signs aren't always updating, I don't know what's causing this, I think it's a Bukkit thing.
 - You need to right-click the sign to initialize the gate, waiting on SIGN_CHANGE hook update.
 
=============
 Permissions
=============
 - stargate.use - Allow this player/group to use stargates.
 - stargate.create - Allow this player/group to create new stargates.
 - stargate.destroy - Allow this player/group to destroy existing stargates.
 - stargate.hidden - Allow this player/group to see all hidden stargates.

Instructions
=============
Building a gate:
    OO 
   O  O - These are Obsidian blocks. You need 10.
   O  O - Place a sign on either of these two blocks of Obsidian.
   O  O
    OO
 - Type a name on the first line on the sign, it must be less than 12 characters long.
 - Type a set destination name on the second line if desired.
 - Type a network name on the third line if desired.
 - Type any options on the 4th line if desired.
 - Right click the sign block to initialize the gate as a Stargate. (Bug Alert: Sign may not update right away)

Sign Layout:
 - Line 1: Gate Name (Max 12 characters)
 - Line 2: Destination Name (Max 12 characters, used for fixed-gates only)
 - Line 3: Network name (Max 12 characters)
 - Line 4: Options ('A' for always-on fixed gate, 'H' for hidden networked gate)

Using a gate:
 - Right click the sign to choose a destination.
 - Right click the button to open up a portal.
 - Step through.

Fixed gates:
 - Fixed gates go to only one set destination.
 - Fixed gates can be linked to other fixed gates, or normal gates. A normal gate cannot open a portal to a fixed gate however.
 - To create a fixed gate, specify a destination on the second line of the stargate sign.
 - Set the 4th line of the stargate sign to "A" to enable an always-open fixed gate.

Gate networks:
 - Gates are all part of a network, by default this is "central".
 - You can specify (and create) your own network on the third line of the sign when making a new gate.
 - Gates on one network will not see gates on the second network, and vice versa.
 
Hidden Gates:
 - Hidden gates are like normal gates, but only show on the destination list of other gates under certain conditions.
 - A hidden gate is only visible to the creator of the gate, or somebody with the stargate.hidden permission.
 - Set the 4th line of the stargate sign to "H" to make it a hidden gate.
